# FrenchPool-2008

This project is a 2D French pool game written in C on my free time just after my first programming courses.

At that time, I didn't have any notions of C++ classes, I used structures to organize my models.

The graphical part was managed with [Allegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegro_(software_library)), a lib we used during our programming lessons.
